*This is my MANAGER README. My personal readme is in a separate document for [quicker access](https://hussainweb.github.io/README/). It would help you to know me better as a manager if you first know me as a person, and I'd recommend you to read that first.*

Hi, I am [**Hussain**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussainweb/), an **Engineering Manager** at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/) who is learning the ropes of working more and more with people rather than machines. I have built, and more importantly, helped others build several [Drupal solutions](https://www.drupal.org/u/hussainweb) over the past few years. I am an introvert pushing myself towards extroversion by speaking at conferences, organising meetups, and pushing myself to introduce myself to others at meetups and conferences. Read my [personal README](https://hussainweb.github.io/README/) to know more about me as a person.

## Hussain, as a manager

I'm looking forward to talk to you and know more about you. I have written this document to describe my working style, my values, and my motivations, so that we may have a more aligned and productive conversation.

I stress on learning fundamentals and theory but balanced with a healthy dose of pragmatism. I care about you as a person first and firmly believe that your well being comes before any work or cause. I try to be nice but not at the expense of being honest. I believe in giving feedback that needs to be heard rather than that which needs to be said. I think it is more important to be kind rather than being right.
